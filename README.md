Overview of the Project: 
This is a JavaScript app where users can create posts, edit them and delete them using the provided user interface. 

How to Run the Application: 
The application is run by simply opening the index.html file or going to the Github Pages link where you will be able to interface with the application. 
This will work with most browsers. 

Reflection: 
The project required a lot of DOM manipulation, and identifying issues in the DOM in order to understand why things were not working. 
I also had issues with connecting the wrong script file in HTML, placing code in the wrong areas and understanding the logic needed
to create buttons and render the posts were what gave me the biggest challenges. Understanding the DOM elements, making sure the buttons updated on the correct post,
structuring the code and understanding what the code was doing to ensure the page worked. Debugging in VScode, the console on the browser, breaking the code into smaller chunks 
and debuging step by step helped me finish it. 

Known Issues:
The edit mode replaces the original post structure entirely instead of editing the original post which eneds up creating a second post with the original content and the edits.
I ran out of time, I could not figure out how to fix it so only the original post remained along with the edits.
